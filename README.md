# RedBus Booking System

üöå A simple, interactive web-based RedBus seat booking system implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates a RedBus ticket booking system with a total of 60 seats, of which 50 seats are pre-booked to simulate real-time availability. Users can:

- View the current status of all seats (Booked / Available).
- Book one or multiple seats by entering seat numbers.
- Exit the app, which disables further interactions and displays a farewell message.

---

## Features

- **Show Available Seats:** Lists all seats along with their current booking status.
- **Book Seats:** Allows booking multiple seats simultaneously by inputting seat numbers separated by spaces.
- **Exit Application:** Disables booking and displays a thank you message.

---

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
2. Click **Show Available Seats** to see the current seat availability.
3. Click **Book Seats** to open a prompt where you can enter seat numbers to book. For example: `51 52 53`.
4. If you want to stop using the app, click **Exit**, which will disable all buttons and display a farewell message.

## Notes

- The system initializes with the first 50 seats pre-booked.
- Input validation ensures only valid seat numbers (1 to 60) are accepted.
- Booking an already booked seat or invalid input shows appropriate error messages.
- Once exited, the app disables interaction to prevent further bookings.
